Execute specific automaton operations for targeted experimentation and analysis.

Execute this operation sequence:

1. Use automaton-execute with operation "self-reference" to trigger recursion
2. Use automaton-execute with operation "evolve" to advance dimensionally
3. Use automaton-execute with operation "self-modify" to mutate structure
4. Use automaton-execute with operation "validate" to check constraints
5. Use automaton-query with query "state" to see resulting changes
6. Use automaton-query with query "modifications" to track mutations

**Autonomous Operations:**
- Use automaton-execute with operation "regenerate" to regenerate kernel from seed
- Use automaton-execute with operation "self-modify" for autonomous self-modification
- Use automaton-execute with operation "goal-negotiate" for multi-agent goal negotiation
- Use automaton-execute with operation "consensus" for consensus voting
- Use automaton-execute with operation "autonomous-evolve" for autonomous evolution

**Geometric Operations:**
- Use automaton-execute with operation "bqf-encode" to encode polyhedra as BQF
- Use automaton-execute with operation "polyhedra-transform" for polyhedra transformations
- Use automaton-execute with operation "compute-mapping" for R5RS type to polyhedra mapping

Then analyze the operation effects:

- **Operation Impact**: How each operation changes system state
- **Dimensional Progression**: Evolution through computational levels
- **Self-Reference Effects**: Recursive pattern changes
- **Modification Patterns**: Structural mutation analysis
- **Validation Results**: System integrity and constraint compliance
- **State Transitions**: Before/after comparison of key metrics

This provides hands-on understanding of how individual operations affect the Church encoding system and computational topology.
