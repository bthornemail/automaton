description: 🚀 Quick start the automaton with default settings
agent: default
subtask: false
---

Start the continuous self-referencing automaton with optimal default settings for exploration.

Use the automaton tool with action "start", interval 1500, maxIterations 100, useOllama false.

Then immediately check the initial state using automaton-query with query "state".

Finally, provide a brief status report showing:
- Current dimension and state
- Total objects in the system
- Self-reference line information
- Next expected actions

This is the fastest way to begin exploring the computational topology canvas.
