Generate comprehensive visualizations of the automaton system and computational topology.

Execute this visualization sequence:

1. Use canvas-visualizer with type "canvas", format "ascii" for overview
2. Use canvas-visualizer with type "evolution", format "text" for progression
3. Use canvas-visualizer with type "self-reference", format "json" for structure
4. Use canvas-visualizer with type "dimension", dimension 0, format "ascii" for foundation
5. Use canvas-visualizer with type "dimension", dimension 7, format "ascii" for quantum level
6. Use canvas-visualizer with type "dimension", dimension 4, format "ascii" for network level

Then create a visual analysis covering:

- **System Architecture**: Overall structure and relationships
- **Dimensional Hierarchy**: How levels build upon each other
- **Evolution Path**: Progression from simple to complex
- **Self-Reference Patterns**: Recursive structure visualization
- **Key Transitions**: Important dimensional shifts
- **Visual Insights**: What the visualizations reveal about system design

Provide both the raw visualizations and interpretive analysis to help understand the computational topology's structure and behavior.
