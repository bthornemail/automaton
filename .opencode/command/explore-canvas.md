Comprehensive exploration of the 59-file Grok computational topology canvas.

Execute this exploration sequence:

1. Use grok-explorer with action "list" to get overview of all files
2. Use grok-explorer with action "analyze" to get statistical insights
3. Use grok-explorer with action "search", searchTerm "church" to find Church encoding references
4. Use grok-explorer with action "search", searchTerm "self-reference" to find recursive patterns
5. Use grok-explorer with action "read", fileNumber 17 to examine the first self-reference point
6. Use grok-explorer with action "read", fileNumber 1 to see the 0D foundation
7. Use grok-explorer with action "read", fileNumber 59 to see the current evolution state

Then provide a comprehensive overview including:

- **Canvas Structure**: How the 59 files progress through dimensions
- **Key Files**: Most important files and their roles
- **Pattern Distribution**: Where different concepts appear
- **Dimensional Progression**: How complexity evolves from 0D to 7D
- **Self-Reference Network**: How files reference each other and the system
- **Exploration Recommendations**: Which files to study for specific insights

This gives a complete map of the computational topology landscape.
