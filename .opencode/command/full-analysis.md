Generate a comprehensive analysis report of the entire automaton system and computational topology canvas.

Execute the following analysis sequence:

1. Use pattern-analyzer with analysis "patterns", scope "both", detail "full"
2. Use pattern-analyzer with analysis "dimensions", scope "both", detail "detailed"  
3. Use pattern-analyzer with analysis "church-encoding", scope "both", detail "full"
4. Use pattern-analyzer with analysis "self-reference", scope "both", detail "full"
5. Use report-generator with reportType "full", format "markdown"

Then synthesize the findings into a comprehensive analysis covering:

- **Pattern Discovery**: Key recurring motifs and their significance
- **Dimensional Analysis**: How each dimension (0D-7D) contributes to the whole
- **Church Encoding Insights**: Lambda calculus patterns and mathematical foundations
- **Self-Reference Depth**: Recursive structure analysis and meta-circular properties
- **Evolutionary Progression**: System growth and complexity trajectories
- **Performance Characteristics**: Efficiency and optimization opportunities
- **Recommendations**: Next steps for exploration and system enhancement

Save the report to `automaton-analysis-report.md` and provide a summary of key findings.
