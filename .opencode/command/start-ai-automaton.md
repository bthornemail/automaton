description: 🧠 Start automaton with AI-powered decision making
agent: default
subtask: false

Start the continuous self-referencing automaton with Ollama AI integration for intelligent action selection.

Use the automaton tool with action "start", interval 2000, maxIterations 50, useOllama true, model "llama3.2".

Then monitor the first few iterations and analyze how the AI chooses actions compared to built-in logic.

Use automaton-query with query "history" to see the decision patterns.

Provide insights on:
- AI vs built-in decision differences
- Action selection patterns
- Efficiency comparisons
- Recommended settings for different exploration goals

Note: Requires Ollama server running with the specified model.
