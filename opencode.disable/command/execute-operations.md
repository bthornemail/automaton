Execute specific automaton operations for targeted experimentation and analysis.

Execute this operation sequence:

1. Use automaton-execute with operation "self-reference" to trigger recursion
2. Use automaton-execute with operation "evolve" to advance dimensionally
3. Use automaton-execute with operation "self-modify" to mutate structure
4. Use automaton-execute with operation "validate" to check constraints
5. Use automaton-query with query "state" to see resulting changes
6. Use automaton-query with query "modifications" to track mutations

Then analyze the operation effects:

- **Operation Impact**: How each operation changes system state
- **Dimensional Progression**: Evolution through computational levels
- **Self-Reference Effects**: Recursive pattern changes
- **Modification Patterns**: Structural mutation analysis
- **Validation Results**: System integrity and constraint compliance
- **State Transitions**: Before/after comparison of key metrics

This provides hands-on understanding of how individual operations affect the Church encoding system and computational topology.
