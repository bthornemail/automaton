# Computational Topology Canvas: A Research Framework

**A Self-Referential Multi-Paradigm Computing System**

## Abstract

The Computational Topology Canvas (CTC) is a novel research framework that integrates Church encoding, multi-agent systems, logic programming (ProLog and DataLog), functional programming (R5RS Scheme), and semantic web technologies (RDF, SPARQL, SHACL) into a unified self-referential system. The framework organizes computation across eight dimensions (0D-7D), each representing a distinct level of computational abstraction, from foundational lambda calculus to quantum computing concepts.

CTC addresses the challenge of integrating multiple programming paradigms while maintaining formal mathematical foundations. By using JSONL (JSON Lines) as both data format and executable representation, the system enables true metacircular evaluation and self-modification. A blackboard architecture facilitates agent coordination through a shared knowledge base queryable via multiple interfaces.

**Key Contributions**:
1. First multi-paradigm framework unifying R5RS, ProLog, DataLog, and RDF/SPARQL
2. Novel dimensional progression hierarchy (0D-7D) based on Church encoding
3. Self-referential automaton system with persistent evolution
4. Integrated blackboard architecture for multi-paradigm agent coordination
5. Educational platform demonstrating theoretical foundations in practice
