# 2D Structural Agent

== Overview ==
The 2D Structural Agent operates at dimension 2D of the Computational Topology Canvas. Manage spatial structure and pattern encoding.

This agent coordinates with other dimensional agents through the blackboard architecture, using SPARQL queries, ProLog inference, and DataLog fact extraction to share information and coordinate operations.
