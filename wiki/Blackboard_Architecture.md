# Blackboard Architecture

== Overview ==
The Computational Topology Canvas uses a blackboard architecture where agents share information through a common data structure (JSONL files). This enables:

- Decoupled agent communication
- Shared knowledge representation
- Query-based coordination
- Self-modification through blackboard updates

The blackboard serves as both data storage and executable code, enabling metacircular evaluation. Agents query the blackboard using SPARQL, ProLog, and DataLog to coordinate operations.
