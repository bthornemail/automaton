# Multi Agent System

== Overview ==
The Computational Topology Canvas implements a multi-agent system with 15 specialized agents operating across dimensions 0D-7D. Each agent is responsible for specific operations within its dimensional scope.

Foundation agents (0D-2D) handle Church encoding and basic topology. Operational agents (3D-4D) manage algebraic operations and network coordination. Advanced agents (5D-7D) implement consensus, intelligence, and quantum operations.

Agents communicate through a blackboard architecture using JSONL files as the shared knowledge base. They coordinate via SPARQL queries, ProLog inference, and DataLog fact extraction.
