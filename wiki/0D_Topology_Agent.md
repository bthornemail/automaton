# 0D Topology Agent

== Overview ==
The 0D Topology Agent operates at dimension 0D of the Computational Topology Canvas. Maintain quantum vacuum topology and identity processes.

This agent coordinates with other dimensional agents through the blackboard architecture, using SPARQL queries, ProLog inference, and DataLog fact extraction to share information and coordinate operations.
