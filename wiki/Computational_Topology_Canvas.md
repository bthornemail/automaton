# Computational Topology Canvas

== Overview ==
The Computational Topology Canvas is a self-referential multi-agent system that implements Church encoding and integrates ProLog, DataLog, and R5RS Scheme for knowledge representation and reasoning. The system spans dimensions 0D through 7D, with each dimension representing a different level of computational abstraction.

The framework uses JSONL files as both data and executable code, enabling true metacircular evaluation. It implements a blackboard architecture where agents coordinate through a shared knowledge base, queryable via SPARQL, ProLog, and DataLog.

Key features include dimensional progression from foundational lambda calculus (0D) through quantum computing (7D), self-modification capabilities, and integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and testing.
