# Church Encoding

== Overview ==
Church encoding is a method of representing data and operators in lambda calculus. The Computational Topology Canvas implements Church numerals, Church booleans, and Church pairs as the foundational layer (0D-2D) of its architecture.

The system uses Church encoding to represent:
- Natural numbers: zero, one, successor, addition, multiplication, exponentiation
- Booleans: true, false, conditional, logical operations
- Pairs: for representing structured data

This encoding provides the mathematical foundation for all higher-dimensional operations.
