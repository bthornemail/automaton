# Automaton System

== Overview ==
The automaton system implements self-referential execution of JSONL/CanvasL files. Automatons can:

- Load and save JSONL canvas files
- Execute actions based on dimensional progression
- Generate Church encoding patterns
- Validate self-reference structures
- Coordinate with multi-agent system

The system supports multiple execution modes:
- Built-in intelligence (continuous-automaton.ts)
- AI-powered via Ollama (ollama-automaton.ts)
- Core engine operations (advanced-automaton.ts)
- Bootstrap process (bootstrap-automaton.ts)
