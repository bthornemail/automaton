# 3D Algebraic Agent

== Overview ==
The 3D Algebraic Agent operates at dimension 3D of the Computational Topology Canvas. Perform Church algebra operations.

This agent coordinates with other dimensional agents through the blackboard architecture, using SPARQL queries, ProLog inference, and DataLog fact extraction to share information and coordinate operations.
