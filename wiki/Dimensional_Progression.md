# Dimensional Progression

== Overview ==
The Computational Topology Canvas organizes computation across eight dimensions (0D-7D), each representing a different level of abstraction:

- 0D: Quantum vacuum topology and identity processes
- 1D: Temporal evolution and Church successor operations
- 2D: Spatial structure and pattern encoding
- 3D: Algebraic operations (addition, multiplication, exponentiation)
- 4D: Network operations and spacetime structure
- 5D: Distributed consensus and blockchain operations
- 6D: Emergent AI and neural network operations
- 7D: Quantum superposition and entanglement

This dimensional progression enables systematic construction of complex systems from foundational primitives.
