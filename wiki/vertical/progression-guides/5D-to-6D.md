# Transition Guide: 5D → 6D

**From Consensus to Intelligence**

---

## Overview

This guide explains the transition from **5D (Consensus)** to **6D (Intelligence)**, showing how agreement mechanisms evolve into learning systems and intelligent reasoning.

---

## What Changes?

### From 5D: Consensus Mechanisms

**5D provides**:
- Consensus topology
- Voting mechanisms
- Blackboard architecture
- Agreement protocols

**Key insight**: Consensus and agreement.

### To 6D: Intelligence Systems

**6D provides**:
- Intelligence topology
- Learning structures
- Pattern recognition
- Meta-Log framework

**Key insight**: Intelligence and learning.

---

## The Transition

### Step 1: Understand 5D Consensus

**Read first**:
- `topology/5D-topology/5D_Consensus_Agent.md` - The Diplomat
- `system/5D-system/Blackboard_Architecture.md` - Shared knowledge

**Key concepts**:
- Consensus: Agreement mechanisms
- Voting: Decision-making
- Blackboard: Shared knowledge base

### Step 2: Introduce Intelligence

**The bridge**: Learning and pattern recognition

**What it does**: Enables systems to learn from experience and recognize patterns.

**Why it matters**: Enables adaptation. After consensus comes intelligence.

**Example**:
- **5D**: Agents agree on decision
- **6D**: Agents learn from decisions and improve

### Step 3: Understand Intelligence Structure

**Read next**:
- `topology/6D-topology/6D_Intelligence_Agent.md` - The Scholar

**Key concepts**:
- Intelligence topology: Learning structures
- Pattern recognition: Identifying patterns
- Knowledge extraction: Learning from data

### Step 4: See the System Implementation

**Read**:
- `system/6D-system/Meta_Log_Framework.md` - Integrated reasoning

**Key concepts**:
- Meta-Log: Unified reasoning framework
- ProLog/DataLog/R5RS: Integrated paradigms
- Reasoning: Logical inference

## Key Differences

| Aspect | 5D (Consensus) | 6D (Intelligence) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | Consensus and agreement | Intelligence and learning |
| **Structure** | Consensus topology | Intelligence topology |
| **Operation** | Consensus operations | Learning operations |
| **Capability** | Agreement | Adaptation |
| **Metaphor** | Diplomacy | Scholarship |

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Agreement to Learning

**5D**: Agents agree on decisions
**6D**: Agents learn from decisions

**Example**:
- **5D**: Vote on proposal, reach consensus
- **6D**: Learn from voting patterns, improve future decisions

### Pattern 2: Blackboard to Knowledge

**5D**: Blackboard (shared knowledge base)
**6D**: Knowledge extraction (learning from blackboard)

**Example**:
- **5D**: Agents write facts to blackboard
- **6D**: Extract patterns from blackboard facts

### Pattern 3: Voting to Reasoning

**5D**: Voting (aggregating opinions)
**6D**: Reasoning (logical inference)

**Example**:
- **5D**: Count votes, determine majority
- **6D**: Infer conclusions from logical rules
