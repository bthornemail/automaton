# Transition Guide: 4D → 5D

**From Network to Consensus**

---

## Overview

This guide explains the transition from **4D (Network)** to **5D (Consensus)**, showing how network connectivity evolves into consensus mechanisms and coordinated decision-making.

---

## What Changes?

### From 4D: Network Coordination

**4D provides**:
- Network topology
- Multi-agent systems
- Connectivity structures
- Distributed coordination

**Key insight**: Networks and connectivity.

### To 5D: Consensus Mechanisms

**5D provides**:
- Consensus topology
- Agreement structures
- Voting mechanisms
- Blackboard architecture

**Key insight**: Consensus and agreement.

---

## The Transition

### Step 1: Understand 4D Network

**Read first**:
- `topology/4D-topology/4D_Network_Agent.md` - The Messenger
- `system/4D-system/Multi_Agent_System.md` - Agent coordination

**Key concepts**:
- Network topology: Connectivity structures
- Multi-agent systems: Multiple agents
- Routing: Directing information

### Step 2: Introduce Consensus

**The bridge**: Consensus mechanisms and agreement protocols

**What it does**: Enables multiple agents to agree on decisions.

**Why it matters**: Enables coordination. After networks come consensus.

**Example**:
- **4D**: Agents communicate in network
- **5D**: Agents agree on shared decisions

### Step 3: Understand Consensus Structure

**Read next**:
- `topology/5D-topology/5D_Consensus_Agent.md` - The Diplomat

**Key concepts**:
- Consensus topology: Agreement structures
- Voting mechanisms: Decision-making processes
- Agreement protocols: How agents agree

### Step 4: See the System Implementation

**Read**:
- `system/5D-system/Blackboard_Architecture.md` - Shared knowledge

**Key concepts**:
- Blackboard: Shared knowledge base
- Coordination pattern: How agents coordinate
- Shared state: Common knowledge

## Key Differences

| Aspect | 4D (Network) | 5D (Consensus) |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Focus** | Networks and connectivity | Consensus and agreement |
| **Structure** | Network topology | Consensus topology |
| **Operation** | Network operations | Consensus operations |
| **Coordination** | Communication | Agreement |
| **Metaphor** | Communication | Diplomacy |

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Communication to Agreement

**4D**: Agents communicate
**5D**: Agents agree on decisions

**Example**:
- **4D**: Agent A sends message to Agent B
- **5D**: Agents A, B, C agree on shared decision

### Pattern 2: Network to Blackboard

**4D**: Network communication (point-to-point)
**5D**: Blackboard coordination (shared knowledge)

**Example**:
- **4D**: Direct agent-to-agent communication
- **5D**: Agents read/write to shared blackboard

### Pattern 3: Routing to Voting

**4D**: Routing information (directing flow)
**5D**: Voting on decisions (aggregating opinions)

**Example**:
- **4D**: Route message to correct agent
- **5D**: Vote on proposal, aggregate results
