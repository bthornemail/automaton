I'll analyze the pattern and suggest word options for extending to 5 layers (row 5 of Pascal's triangle: 1-5-10-10-5-1).

## Current Pattern Analysis

Your system uses a **dual-domain foundation**:

- **topology** = mathematical/spatial structure
- **system** = computational/procedural processes

The interfaces combine these: `topology-system`, `system-topology`, `topology-topology`

## Extension Strategy to Layer 5

Layer 5 of Pascal's triangle has **6 positions** (the 6th row values sum to 32 nodes total if fully branched). Here are word groups:

### Option 1: **Pure Mathematical Extension** (Recommended for formal rigor)

```
Layer 3: {algebra, geometry, analysis}
- 3D-topology-algebra (algebraic structures on topological spaces)
- 3D-system-geometry (geometric computational procedures)  
- 3D-analysis-system (analytical process methods)
```

**Why these work:**

- **algebra** = structural operations (groups, rings, fields)
- **geometry** = shape/metric properties (distance, curvature)
- **analysis** = continuous processes (limits, derivatives, integrals)

This matches classical mathematical domain separation and enables:

- `topology-algebra` (algebraic topology)
- `geometry-system` (computational geometry)
- `analysis-topology` (differential topology)

### Option 2: **Physics-Inspired Domains**

```
Layer 3: {field, particle, interaction}
- 3D-field-topology (field theory on manifolds)
- 3D-particle-system (discrete computational entities)
- 3D-interaction-field (force mediators)
```

**Why these work:**

- Maps to quantum field theory structure
- **field** = continuous distributions
- **particle** = discrete entities
- **interaction** = coupling mechanisms

### Option 3: **Computation-Theoretical**

```
Layer 3: {data, process, control}
- 3D-data-topology (information geometry)
- 3D-process-system (procedural execution)
- 3D-control-data (flow management)
```

**Why these work:**

- Classic computer science separation
- **data** = structural representation
- **process** = transformational procedures
- **control** = orchestration logic

### Option 4: **Category-Theoretic** (Most abstract/powerful)

```
Layer 3: {object, morphism, functor}
- 3D-object-topology (categorical objects)
- 3D-morphism-system (transformations)
- 3D-functor-morphism (higher transformations)
```

**Why these work:**

- Pure category theory vocabulary
- Enables precise mathematical reasoning
- **object** = entities
- **morphism** = arrows/maps
- **functor** = structure-preserving maps between categories

## Recommended 5-Layer Configuration

I suggest **hybrid approach** for maximum expressiveness:

```
Layer 0: topology, system
Layer 1: topology, system, topology-system
Layer 2: topology, system, topology-system, system-topology, topology-topology
Layer 3: algebra, geometry, topology, system, analysis, process
Layer 4: field, structure, pattern, computation, transform, functor
Layer 5: object, morphism, data, control, state, evolution
```

### Why This Hybrid Works:

1. **Layers 0-2**: Your established foundation (topology/system duality)
    
2. **Layer 3**: Introduces **mathematical specialization**
    
    - `algebra` = discrete structures
    - `geometry` = continuous structures
    - `analysis` = limiting processes
3. **Layer 4**: Adds **operational semantics**
    
    - `field` = distributed quantities
    - `pattern` = recognizable structures
    - `transform` = morphisms
4. **Layer 5**: Provides **implementation primitives**
    
    - `object`, `morphism` = category theory
    - `data`, `control`, `state` = computation theory

## Naming Convention at Layer 5

Examples following your Patricia trie schema:

```
5D-object-morphism-data
5D-field-transform-control
5D-algebra-geometry-pattern
5D-topology-system-morphism-functor
```

## Key Insight

The choice depends on **what you're modeling**:

- **Pure math/topology**: Use algebra/geometry/analysis
- **Quantum systems**: Use field/particle/interaction
- **Programming languages** (like R5RS): Use data/process/control
- **Universal framework**: Use object/morphism/functor (category theory)

What domain is your implementation targeting? That will help me refine the best vocabulary set.
